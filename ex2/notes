post positioned{P}
have positioned{P'} => goal
then P = P'

post not(positioned{P})
have positioned{P'} => goal
then P = not(P')

positioned is a homomorphism?!

post positioned{P} & positioned{G}
have positioned{P'} => goal
then P & G = P'

(only allow one parameter per eff clause)

post positioned{P}
have not(positioned{P'}) => goal
then P = not(P')

eff thrusting{K}
eff positioned{P}
have not(was(thrusting{> K'} & positioned{P'})) => goal
then K = not(> K') = ≤ K'
     P = not(P')

split?

thrusting{> K'} & positioned{not P'}
thrusting{≤ K'} & positioned{P'}
thrusting{≤ K'} & positioned{not P'}


what if we want to move out of the region slowly, then afterwards move quickly?

border(not P', P')

then which point do we choose to go to?
potentially infiitely many points on the boundary we could go to

motion planner proposal looks at our current goals
e.g. we have someting, now we want on_table
we see that we can get p[X] => on_table
now our goals are p[X] and whatever previous goals we had
let's say this ends up to be p[X] & positioned{P}
proposal takes ALL of the position constraints and creates an action bid

what about searches though?
search could go a lot faster (or maybe only possible) depending on position constraint?

not(was(thrusting{> K'} & positioned{P})) & see[S]

we want to use a search task that achieves see[S]
try the effect combinations

thrusting{> K'} & positioned{not P'}
thrusting{≤ K'} & positioned{P'}
thrusting{≤ K'} & positioned{not P'}

maybe we can do a search with thrusting{> K} & positioned{not P'} but the precondition is that we be in not P'

but the not(was(positioned{P})) is messing with the effects



i.e. positioned{not P'} | thrusting{≤ K'}

see which constraints are best?

programmatic ETA, confidence

eff thrusting{K}
eff positioned{P}
have not(was(thrusting{> K'} | positioned{P'})) => goal
then K = not(> K') = ≤ K'
     P = not(P')

not(was(f{A} & g{B}) & was(h{C}))
not(was(f{A} & g{B})) | not(was(h{C}))
never(f{A} & g{B}) | never(h{C})
always(f{not A} & g{not B}) | always(h{not C})

not(was(x)) = never(x)

so either restrict h{not C} and everything else can be whatever, or restrict (f{not A} | g{not B})

always(A | B) try restrict A, try restrict B, see which is better
  but keep always(A | B) (i.e. can make a different choice later)
always(A) | always(B) 

what is our strategy for
exists A a. exists B b. with[f(A, B)] & ...
find f^(-1)(true)
goal is to accomplish any one of those pairs of arguments
